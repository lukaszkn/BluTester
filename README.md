# BluTester
This is sample SwiftUI app with simple CoreBluetooth/BLE framework implementation.<br />
iOS app running on iPhone 11 sends text to be displayed on LCD screen.<br />
<br />
Arduino UNO Wifi was used as hardware including BBMobile BLE module.<br />
The project is not optimised as lack of BLE module specification.<br />
